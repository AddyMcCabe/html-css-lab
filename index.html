    The gallowglasses (also spelled galloglass, gallowglas or galloglas; from Irish: gallóglaigh meaning foreign warriors) were a class of elite mercenary warriors who were principally members of the Norse-Gaelic clans of Ireland between the mid 13th century and late 16th century. Originally applied to Scots, who shared a common background and language with the Irish, but as they were descendants of 10th-century Norse settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland, the Irish called them Gall Gaeil ("foreign Gaels").
        An early family of gallowglasses was the McCabes and several other groups settled by powerful Irish nobles in different areas. The gallowglasses were attractive as heavily armored, trained infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position. They would also often be used as a rear gaurd because of their reputation for choosing death over retreat. The McCabe family motto is "aut vincere aut mori" wich translates to "either to conquer or to die". Soon most gallowglasses were native Irish and the term came to mean a type of warrior, rather than any ethnic designation.</p>

        <div><h2>Weapons and Armor of the Gallowglass</h2>
        <p>The Gallowglass wore chainmail armor and helmets. But it was their weapons most of all that reminded onlookers of the Vikings. The traditional gallowglass weapon was a large two-handed axe called a sparth, reminiscent of the Dane axe used by the Vikings. These weapons were the source of terror to their enemies as the shaft was nearly six feet (1.8m) in length. They were also known to use the claymore, a Scottish variant of the late medieval two-handed sword.</p></div>

         <div><h2>Vikings and the Gallowglass</h2>
        <p>Gallowglass are descendants of the Vikings through way of the Scots. The Vikings raided heavily there and had a lasting effect on the culture in the wester highlands of Scotland. A Scottish historian Fergus Cannan notes, the Gallowglass “lived for war.…His sole function was to fight, and his only contribution to society was destruction.” From this picture it is nor hard to see how the similarities.</p>
