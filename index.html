    <h1>The Gallowglass</h1>
    <h3>Norse-Gaelic mercenaries of Ireland</h3>

    The gallowglasses (also spelled galloglass, gallowglas or galloglas; from Irish: gallóglaigh meaning foreign warriors) were a class of elite mercenary warriors who were principally members of the Norse-Gaelic clans of Ireland between the mid 13th century and late 16th century. Originally applied to Scots, who shared a common background and language with the Irish, but as they were descendants of 10th-century Norse settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland, the Irish called them Gall Gaeil ("foreign Gaels").
        An early family of gallowglasses was the MacSweeneys, settled by the O'Donnells in north Donegal. These were followed by MacDonnells, McCabes and several other groups settled by powerful Irish nobles in different areas. The gallowglasses were attractive as heavily armored, trained infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position, unlike most Irish foot soldiers, who were less well armoured than the typical Irish noble who fought as cavalry. Soon most gallowglasses were native Irish and the term came to mean a type of warrior, rather than any ethnic designation.</p>

        <div><h2>Weapons and Armor of the Gallowglass</h2>
        <p>The Gallowglass wore chainmail armor and helmets. But it was their weapons most of all that reminded onlookers of the Vikings. The traditional gallowglass weapon was a large two-handed axe called a sparth, reminiscent of the Dane axe used by the Vikings. These weapons were the source of terror to their enemies as the haft was nearly six feet (1.8m) in length. They were also known to the claymore, a Scottish variant of the late medieval two-handed sword.</p></div>

         <div><h2>Vikings and the Gallowglass</h2>
        <p>Gallowglass are descendants of not only Vikings but of Scots native to the western Highlands and Hebrides. As Scottish historian Fergus Cannan notes, the Gallowglass “lived for war.…His sole function was to fight, and his only contribution to society was destruction.”</p>
